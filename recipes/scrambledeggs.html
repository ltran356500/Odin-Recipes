            <li>
                Crack eggs into a bowl and mix or whisk until 
                well blended with no separation of egg whites 
                and yolk. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Chop green onions and set aside. Heat pan on medium 
                low heat and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Once pan is hot enough, place green onions and cook for 
                about a minute and then add eggs into pan.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Slowly and gently move eggs around in pan until not runny 
                anymore. Cook until desired doneness and remove from 
                pan. Your scrambled eggs are ready to eat!
