    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of water</li>
        <li>3 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 stalks green onion</li>
        <li>1 medium or large onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup uncooked rice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Msg</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring the water with the chicken thighs to a boil
            on medium high to high heat. Season broth with 2 tsp
             of salt, 2 tsp of fish sauce and 1 tsp MSG. Boil until 
             chicken thighs are cook (about 25-30 minutes). Make 
             sure to skim off impurities from top of broth.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Chop green onions and set aside for the end to 
            garish. Chop half onion and dice one half and set
             aside for garish. Boil other half of onion in broth.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Once chicken thighs are cooked, take out and place in 
            a bowl to cool down. Once cooled down enough either 
            shred or chop the chicken and place back into broth.
        </li>

        <li>
            While waiting for chicken to cool, rinse the rice 
            until water is clear. Once rinsed, place into broth 
            and cook on high heat until rice is soft.
        </li>

        <li>
            Congee is done whenever the rice is soft or at the 
            consistency you prefer. Ladel into bowl and season 
            with more salt, fish sauce and pepper to preferred 
            taste. Garish with green onions and diced onion and 
            enjoy!
