        <ol>
            <li>Pour olive oil into instant pot and select Saute function.
                Cook onion, carrot, celery and bay leaf until veggies are 
                soft and onion translucent. Roughly 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add broth, chicken thighs and breast, spices/seasonings.
                Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to
                manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes and 
                allow 10-15 minutes for pressure to build.
            </li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using quick release method
                based on manufacturer's instructions for about 5 minutes. 
                Carefully remove chicken pieces with tongs and place in 
                bowl to cool slightly. Discard bay leaf.
            </li>
            <li>Mash butter and flour together until a smooth paste and set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder and salt in bowl for dumplings.
                Cut in cold butter until mixture is texture of cornmeal.
                Stir in parsley and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Shred cooled chicken and return to pot. Taste and season
                broth if needed. Add peas and stir in flour-butter paste.
                Select Saute function to bring broth back to boil.
            </li>
            <li>Pour buttermilk into dumpling mixture and stir until mixed. 
                Drop dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of stew; 
                a small cookie scoop works well.
            </li>
            <li>Cover pot with lid, leaving steam vent open. Select Slow 
                Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings 
                are cooked through (10-12 minutes). Insert skewer into 
                center of a dumpling and it should come out clean.
            </li>
